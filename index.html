            <p>I've written code to play lots of simulations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a>.</p>
            <p>The outcomes of these simulations are shown on the graph below.</p>
            <p>The red points show the cumulative number of wins when using the "stick" strategy.</p>
            <p>The yellow points show the cumulative number of wins when using the "switch" strategy.</p>
            <p>The "guesses" that the simulated player makes are randomised* each time this page is loaded, so if you want to convince yourself further, try reloading the page a few times and see how the graph changes. The shape of the plots varies, but the switch strategy clearly leads to a greater number of wins.</p>
            <p>*(pseudo-randomised using JavaScript's Math.random, which has an "approximately uniform distribution")</p>

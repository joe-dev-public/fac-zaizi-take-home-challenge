            <p>I've written code to play lots of simulations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a>.</p>
            <p>The outcomes of these simulations are shown on the graph below.</p>
            <p>The orange points show the cumulative number of wins when using the "stick" strategy.</p>
            <p>The blue points show the cumulative number of wins when using the "switch" strategy.</p>
            <p>The "guesses" that the simulated player makes are randomised<sup id="footnote-1" class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1-ref">[1]</a></sup> each time you click the "Simulate" button.</p>
            <p>The shape of the plots varies, but the switch strategy clearly leads to a greater number of wins.</p>

                <h2>What the graph shows:</h2>
                <p>After <span class="total-number-of-games stat"></span> games, the stick strategy produced <span class="total-number-of-stick-wins stat"></span> wins, and the switch strategy produced <span class="total-number-of-switch-wins stat"></span> wins.</p>
                <p>So, for the <span class="total-number-of-games stat"></span> games simulated, the switch strategy produced about <span class="switch-vs-stick-calculation stat"></span> more wins than the stick strategy.</p>
                <p>In other words, <b>the switch strategy is about twice as successful as the stick strategy</b>.</p>
                <p>This tallies with vos Savant's solution, that "the switching strategy has a 2/3 probability of winning the car, while the strategy that remains with the initial choice has only a 1/3 probability" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">source</a>).<!-- In other words, that the switch strategy is twice as probable to win as the stick strategy.--></p>
